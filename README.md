# Prerequisites

## Flutter SDK

Install the **stable** version of Flutter in a folder **without spaces**.

Example:

```
C:\src\flutter
```

Add:

```
flutter/bin
```

to your **PATH**, then verify your installation:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

---

## Android Studio

Install Android Studio and open:

```
SDK Manager
```

Enable:

- Android SDK Command-line Tools
- Android SDK Platform
- NDK (Side by side)

Accept Android licenses:

```bash
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

---

## iOS

Building an iOS application requires:

- macOS
- Xcode
- Apple Developer Account

**Building iOS applications is not possible directly on Windows.**

---

# Clone the Project

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Theo974L/Youtube-MP3-Mobile.git
```

Go inside the project:

```bash
cd Youtube-MP3-Mobile
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

> **Windows Tip**
>
> If your project is located inside the **Documents** folder and synchronized with OneDrive, pause OneDrive synchronization during builds and add the project folder to your antivirus exclusions.

---

# Android

Run the application:

```bash
flutter run
```

---

## Build Release APK

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

Generated file:

```
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

Install it by opening the APK on your Android device.

---

## Google Play Bundle

```bash
flutter build appbundle
```

Generated file:

```
build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

---

# iOS

## Build on macOS

```bash
flutter build ipa --release
```

Generated file:

```
build/ios/ipa/
```

You can also deploy directly to a connected iPhone:

```bash
flutter run --release
```

---

## Build without a Mac (Codemagic)

This repository already contains a **codemagic.yaml** configuration.

Steps:

1. Push the project to GitHub.
2. Create a Codemagic account.
3. Connect your repository.
4. Configure your Apple API Key.
5. Create the App ID:

```
com.laforge.ytOffline
```

6. Launch the **ios-release** workflow.
7. Download the generated IPA.
8. Install using TestFlight.

# Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| `flutter` command not found | Add Flutter to PATH |
| Android licenses missing | `flutter doctor --android-licenses` |
| NDK installation failed | Install NDK directly from Android Studio |
| `adb: failed to install` | Cold Boot emulator or use USB |
| Slow Gradle build | Pause OneDrive & exclude project from antivirus |
| Slow ADB over Wi-Fi | Prefer USB connection |

---

# Dependencies

The application relies on:

- Flutter
- Dart
- youtube_explode_dart

If YouTube extraction stops working:

```bash
flutter pub upgrade youtube_explode_dart
```
